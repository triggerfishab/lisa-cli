## ‚úèÔ∏è Commands

### path \<PATH\>
Use this command to set your global sites path to prevent you from running other commands from the wrong directory

### configure
Before setting up your first site, you will need to run this command to enter all the necessary API keys that the program uses. All of these can be found in the "Lisa CLI" item in 1Password.

### kinsta
Use this command to get a template file for all your Kinsta configuration values.

Example: `lisa kinsta > kinsta.yml`

After the file has been created, update all existing values with the corresponding values from the site at Kinsta that you created earlier.

### init
This command will create a new Lisa site for you. You will get both a WordPress API and a Next.js application for the frontend.

The following will be included:
* GitHub repos
* Amazon AWS S3 bucket for media handling
* StackPath CDN for media files
* GoDaddy records for DNS
* Sendgrid subuser for email sending

When the command is done, you will have the following on your computer:
* API site linked to Valet on the domain https://{projectName}-api.test
* Next.js frontend app on http://localhost:3000

### clone
If you want to setup an already existing Lisa site for local development, you can just run the following command:

### db import
Use this command to import a database from the production/staging environment of the site that you're working on. A prompt will ask you whether you will import it from staging or production

This command will ask for the project name and try to find the correct repos that you should use. If not the correct repos are found, the prompt will let you specify them manually.
